# Smart Accident Detection And Alert System
## Introduction
 The Smart Accident Detection and Alert System is an IoT integrated system that is designed to safeguard lives and reduce response times during accidents and emergencies. By identifying sudden vehicle movements or tilts in any direction, an accident could be signaled which is notified to the preconfigured numbers as an SMS in a Google Map Link form consisting of the accident location retrieved from GPS and the vehicle number. A trigger button is also integrated that allows drivers to prevent automatic alerts for minor incidents based on the timer set, giving them control over the system's response.
